## MazeGen presentation :
    MazeGen is a maze generator. The goal with MazeGen was to provide a simple and flexible system for generating mazes. I hope in the futur MazeGen becom an easy framework for maze generation and let you adapt it to your games and map's themes.

## How to start :
    A quick tour of the asset and how to setup here @ref SetupGuide

## How MazeGen can be adapted to your needs :
    Currently MazeGen support custom prefabs as piece of maze and a simple maze generation algorithm wich is agent based and pretty performant. This type of generation should be enough for people who want a basic maze but you can extend existing algorithm to change the generation behaviour. If you just want to customize the maze and not the generation behavior, "MazeProcessor" is an extensible class provided for that purpose.\n
